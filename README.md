Image Carousel over Video Background


The app features an image Carousel which displays a loop of 7 images as a foreground view, and in the background, a full-screen video is played in mute as specified. Native library is used for playing video that is VideoView and for Image Carousel Horizontal Recycler View is used. Previous button and Next button helps in scrolling to previous and next image by an offset of 1.Video and Images are displayed from the given URL itself. Glide library is used for displaying the images reducing the delay. MVC is the architecture pattern that I followed. An Important Decision that I took was trying to implement image Carousel using Recycler View, the usual custom is to use ViewPager but I thought of trying in a different manner and I was able to complete it successfully in the most elegant way.
